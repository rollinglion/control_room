# Data Directory

This folder will contain imported or processed datasets used by the Control Room map.

Expected formats:
- CSV (with lat/lon or postcodes)
- GeoJSON (points, lines, polygons)
- TopoJSON (UK boundaries)

Raw imports should not be edited manually.
Processed / normalised outputs will be generated later by ingestion scripts.
